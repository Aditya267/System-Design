### **Requirements of a Newsfeed System**  

You're designing a **newsfeed system** for a huge social media platform like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. It needs to show the right posts to the right people **fast**! Hereâ€™s what we need to consider:

### **ðŸ“Œ Functional Requirements (What the System Must Do)**
1. **Generate the Newsfeed** ðŸ“œ  
   - The system must collect posts from friends, groups, and pages you follow.  
   - Since users have **many** connections, we need a smart way to decide **which posts** to show.  

2. **Whatâ€™s in the Newsfeed?** ðŸ“·ðŸŽ¥  
   - The feed can include **text, images, videos, likes, comments, and ads**.  

3. **How to Display It?** ðŸ“Š  
   - New posts should **appear instantly** for active users.  
   - Posts should be **ranked**, so the most **important** or **interesting** ones show up first.

### **ðŸ“Œ Non-Functional Requirements (How the System Should Perform)**
1. **Scalability** ðŸš€  
   - The system should work smoothly even if **millions or billions** of people use it.  

2. **Fault Tolerance** ðŸ›   
   - Even if some servers **fail**, the system should keep running **without crashing**.  

3. **Availability** âœ…  
   - The newsfeed should always be accessibleâ€”users shouldnâ€™t see an error page.  
   - The system **chooses availability** over strong consistency (meaning some posts may appear slightly late, but the feed never stops working).  

4. **Low Latency (Super Fast!)** âš¡  
   - The newsfeed should load in **under 2 seconds**, even with millions of users.

ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR**: The newsfeed system must **collect, rank, and display** posts quickly and **at scale**, ensuring itâ€™s always **available**, **fault-tolerant**, and **super fast** for billions of users! ðŸš€ðŸ“²
