### **What is a Newsfeed? (ELI5 Style)**
Imagine your **newsfeed** is like a **magic bulletin board** 📜 where you see updates from your friends, favorite celebrities, and pages you follow. Every time someone posts a new picture, video, or status, it **magically appears** on your board!  

### **How Does It Work?**  
1. **You Follow People** 👥 → You choose who you want to see updates from (friends, influencers, pages, etc.).  
2. **They Post Stuff** 📝 → People post text, pictures, videos, likes, shares, ads, and more.  
3. **The Newsfeed Updates** 🔄 → The system collects all new posts and **shows the most relevant ones** to you.  

### **Why is a Newsfeed Important?**  
- Keeps you **updated** on what’s happening with friends, news, and trends.  
- Makes social media **interesting**, so you keep coming back.  
- Works for **billions of people** at the same time! 🚀  

### **The Big Challenge**  
Since **so many people** use social media, the system must be **fast**, **personalized**, and **always available**. It needs to decide:  
✅ **Which posts to show first?** (Newer? More likes? From close friends?)  
✅ **How to handle billions of users?** (Huge scale!)  
✅ **How to make updates appear instantly?** (Real-time magic!)  


### **How Do We Design a Newsfeed System?**
To create a **newsfeed system** (like Facebook or Twitter), we **break it into 3 steps**:

### **1️⃣ [Requirements (What the System Needs)](Requirements.md)**
Before building, we must decide:  
✅ **What should the feed show?** (Posts, likes, ads, etc.)  
✅ **How to rank posts?** (Newer? More likes? Friends first?)  
✅ **How to handle billions of users?** (Fast & scalable)

### **2️⃣ Design (How It Works)**
Once we know what we need, we design:  
🛠 **How do we store data?** (Database setup)  
⚙ **How do we rank posts?** (Algorithms & machine learning)  
📡 **How do we send updates fast?** (Real-time systems like WebSockets)  

---

### **3️⃣ Evaluation (Does It Work Well?)**
After building, we **test & improve**:  
📊 **Is it fast?** (Loads in under 2 seconds)  
🔄 **Does it update in real time?** (New posts appear instantly)  
🔧 **Can it handle billions of users?** (Scalable & reliable)  

---

💡 **TL;DR**: A **newsfeed** shows **personalized posts** in real time. To design one, we **define requirements, build a ranking system, and optimize performance**—making sure it's **fast, relevant, and scalable**! 🚀📲
